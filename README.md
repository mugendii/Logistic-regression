# Logistic-regression

> Your target variable will be have two possible values: “Satisfaction” or “neutral or dissatisfaction”.
1. Please provide a data analysis of the relevant data. We will not provide you with what to look for, but your goal is to provide a neat data analysis which describes the data and detects the most interesting patterns you could find, from the variables themselves as well as from their connection with each other and/or the target variable. Feel free to accompany your analysis with textual comments and conclusions, plots, tables etc.
2. Please train a logistic regression machine learning model in order to predict “Satisfaction”.
3. Please try to explain your model. How does it “think”, what are the relevant features and their effect on the target prediction.
4. Do you think all available features should be used in the model? Would you remove any of them? Explain.
